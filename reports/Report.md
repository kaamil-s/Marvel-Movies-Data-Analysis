# Marvel Movies Data Analytics: Insights & Trends  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies, focusing on revenue trends, profitability, and ratings. The goal is to uncover insights into how budget, revenue, and audience reception impact the success of MCU movies.  

## Dataset Overview

## Methodology  
### Phase 1: Data Acquisition

- Inspected missing values and inconsistencies  

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing  
- Converted `Release Date` to DateTime format  
- Created new columns:  
   - `Profit = Worldwide Gross - Budget`  
   - `Profit Margin = (Profit / Budget) * 100`  
- Cleaned missing/incorrect data  

### Phase 3: Data Analysis & Visualization  
**Budget vs. Revenue:**  
   - Higher-budget movies tend to perform better financially

**Ratings Analysis:**  
   - Audience scores vs. critics' ratings show divergence  
   - Critics rate some movies lower than audiences do  

### Phase 4: Exporting for Power BI  
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `Marvel_Cleaned.csv` for Power BI visualization  

### Phase 5: Power BI Dashboard  
- Created interactive charts and dashboards showcasing:  
   - Revenue trends over time  
   - Budget vs. earnings  
   - Profit margins of top MCU movies  
   - Comparison of audience vs. critic ratings  

## Key Insights
